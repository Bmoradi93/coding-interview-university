## std::queue:
std::queue is another container adapter in C++ that provides a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure. It is implemented as an adapter over other container classes, such as std::deque or std::list.

Some of the key features of std::queue are:

* It is a templated class, meaning that it can store elements of any data type.
* It only allows insertion of elements at the back and removal of elements from the front.
* It does not allow direct access to elements in the middle of the queue.
* It automatically resizes the underlying container as needed.
* It provides functions to check the size of the queue and to access the front and back elements.

Here's an example of how to use std::queue:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
  std::queue<int> my_queue;

  my_queue.push(10);
  my_queue.push(20);
  my_queue.push(30);

  std::cout << "The front element of the queue is: " << my_queue.front() << std::endl;

  my_queue.pop();

  std::cout << "The front element of the queue is now: " << my_queue.front() << std::endl;

  std::cout << "The size of the queue is: " << my_queue.size() << std::endl;

  return 0;
}

```
