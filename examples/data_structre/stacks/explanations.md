## std::stack:
std::stack is a container adapter in C++ that provides a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure. It is implemented as an adapter over other container classes, such as std::deque, std::list, or std::vector.

Some of the key features of std::stack are:

* It is a templated class, meaning that it can store elements of any data type.
* It only allows insertion and deletion of elements from the top of the stack.
* It does not allow direct access to elements in the middle of the stack.
* It automatically resizes the underlying container as needed.
* It provides functions to check the size of the stack and to access the top element.

Here's an example of how to use std::stack:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

int main() {
  std::stack<int> my_stack;

  my_stack.push(10);
  my_stack.push(20);
  my_stack.push(30);

  std::cout << "The top element of the stack is: " << my_stack.top() << std::endl;

  my_stack.pop();

  std::cout << "The top element of the stack is now: " << my_stack.top() << std::endl;

  std::cout << "The size of the stack is: " << my_stack.size() << std::endl;

  return 0;
}

```
