## What is a data structure in computer science?
In computer science, a data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. It is essentially a way of organizing and managing data so that it can be easily manipulated and processed.

There are many different types of data structures, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each of these data structures has its own set of operations that can be performed on it, such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting.

Choosing the right data structure for a particular problem or task is important for optimizing the efficiency and speed of a computer program. Different data structures are better suited for different types of data and different types of operations. Understanding data structures is a fundamental concept in computer science and is essential for writing efficient and effective computer programs.

## List of all data structures in the CPP-STL:
The STL (Standard Template Library) in C++ provides a rich set of container classes that can be used to store and manipulate data efficiently. Here is a list of all container classes in the STL:

* sequence containers:
```
vector: a dynamic array that can be resized
deque: a double-ended queue
list: a doubly linked list
forward_list: a singly linked list

```

* associative containers:
```
set: a sorted set of unique elements
multiset: a sorted set of elements that can be repeated
map: a sorted map of unique keys and their associated values
multimap: a sorted map of keys and their associated values that can be repeated
```

* unordered associative containers:
```
unordered_set: an unordered set of unique elements
unordered_multiset: an unordered set of elements that can be repeated
unordered_map: an unordered map of unique keys and their associated values
unordered_multimap: an unordered map of keys and their associated values that can be repeated
```

* container adaptors:
```
stack: a container that provides a LIFO (last-in, first-out) interface
queue: a container that provides a FIFO (first-in, first-out) interface
priority_queue: a container that provides a priority queue interface
```

Each container class provides different features and performance characteristics that make them suitable for different use cases. It is important to choose the right container class for the task at hand to ensure efficient and correct code.
