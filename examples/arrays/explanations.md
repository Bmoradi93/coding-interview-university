There have been several C++ features developed for working with arrays in recent years. 
Here are some of the latest features:

## std::array:
This is a container class template introduced in C++11 that provides a fixed-size array with a static size that is determined at compile time. It has many advantages over the traditional C-style array, including better type safety, bounds checking, and a consistent interface with other STL containers.
