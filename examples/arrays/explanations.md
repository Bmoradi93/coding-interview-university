There have been several C++ features developed for working with arrays in recent years. 
Here are some of the latest features:

## std::array:
This is a container class template introduced in C++11 that provides a fixed-size array with a static size that is determined at compile time. It has many advantages over the traditional C-style array, including better type safety, bounds checking, and a consistent interface with other STL containers.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main() {
    std::array<int, 5> myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (int i = 0; i < myArray.size(); i++) {
        std::cout << myArray[i] << " ";
    }

    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```


## Range-based for loops: 
This is a feature introduced in C++11 that simplifies iterating over arrays and other containers. Instead of using a traditional for loop with an index variable, you can use a range-based for loop that iterates over the elements of the container directly.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <array>

int main() {
    std::array<int, 5> myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (int elem : myArray) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }

    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```


## std::size:
std::size is a function template introduced in C++17 that provides a standard way to get the size of an array at compile time. It is similar to the sizeof operator, but it works with arrays of any type. The std::size function returns the number of elements in the array, which is a compile-time constant.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string myArray[] = {"foo", "bar", "baz"};

    std::cout << "Size of myArray: " << std::size(myArray) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## std::span: 
This is a container class introduced in C++20 that provides a view over a contiguous sequence of elements, such as an array or a std::vector. It is similar to std::array, but with a dynamic size that can be determined at runtime.
One advantage of using std::span over traditional arrays or pointers is that it provides bounds checking at runtime. If you try to access an element outside of the range of the span, it will throw an exception. This can help prevent common bugs and improve the safety of your code.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <span>

int main() {
    int myArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::span<int> mySpan(myArray, 5);

    for (int elem : mySpan) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }

    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## std::fill_n: 
std::fill_n is a function template in the C++ standard library that fills a range of n elements with a specified value. It is a convenient way to initialize a block of memory with a specific value.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int myArray[5];

    // Fill the first 3 elements of the array with the value 42
    std::fill_n(myArray, 3, 42);

    // Print out the contents of the array
    for (int elem : myArray) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }

    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

```

Note that std::fill_n does not perform any bounds checking, so it is important to make sure that the range of elements you are filling does not exceed the size of the array. If you need to fill the entire array, you can use std::fill instead:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    int myArray[5];

    // Fill the entire array with the value 42
    std::fill(std::begin(myArray), std::end(myArray), 42);

    // Print out the contents of the array
    for (int elem : myArray) {
        std::cout << elem << " ";
    }

    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

```

## std::reduce:
std::reduce is a function template in the C++ standard library that applies a binary operation to the elements in a range and returns the result. It is similar to std::accumulate, but it allows the compiler to optimize the operation by rearranging the order of the operations and using parallel execution on multiple threads.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> myVector{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Calculate the sum of the elements in the vector
    int sum = std::reduce(myVector.begin(), myVector.end(), 0, std::plus<int>());

    std::cout << "Sum of the elements: " << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Note that std::reduce can also take an optional execution policy argument, which allows the operation to be performed in parallel using multiple threads:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>
#include <execution>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> myVector{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Calculate the sum of the elements in the vector in parallel
    int sum = std::reduce(std::execution::par, myVector.begin(), myVector.end(), 0, std::plus<int>());

    std::cout << "Sum of the elements: " << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use std::execution::par to specify that the operation should be performed in parallel. This can provide a significant performance boost when operating on large ranges of elements.
