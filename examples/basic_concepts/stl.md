## Standard Template Library:
STL stands for Standard Template Library. It is a powerful library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators that provides a set of common data structures and functions to be used in C++ programs.

The STL is a part of the C++ Standard Library and is included in the standard C++ distribution. It is designed to make programming in C++ easier and more efficient by providing generic, reusable components that can be used for a variety of tasks.

The container classes in the STL include vector, list, map, set, and many more. These classes provide dynamic arrays, linked lists, associative arrays, and other commonly used data structures. The algorithms in the STL include functions like sorting, searching, merging, and transforming, which can be used on any container class that supports the necessary operations.

The STL's iterators provide a way to access the elements of a container class in a generic way, making it easy to write algorithms that work with any container class that supports the necessary operations.

Overall, the STL is a powerful and versatile library that is widely used in C++ programming, making it an important tool for any C++ programmer to know and understand.
